v5.0.0 (2025-02-09)
===================

- Change the root scope to `text.html.cs`.  WebForms gets
  `text.html.cs.webforms` and Razor gets `text.html.cs.razor`.  This matches
  the upstream pattern in files shipped with Sublime Text.  We've been lagging
  a bit behind.

    + *Breaking change:* If you have snippets or other support files targeting
      `embedding.cshtml`, you need to update them.

- There are new commands in the command palette to open the CodeBehind or
  CodeFile from a frontend page and to open the frontend from a CodeBehind or
  CodeFile.  These commands are not perfect, but they've been helpful to me.

- JavaScript and CSS containing embedded C# work where they previously did not.

- Fix the 2500 context sanity limit for people who were seeing that message.

- Minor Razor improvements.  There is plenty of opportunity to help with Razor
  if you are interested.

Shoutout to SC, TK, EV. All my best.
